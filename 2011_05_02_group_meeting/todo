Manipulating infinite posets.
=============================

based on a paper by Reinhard Diestel and Oleg Pikhurko:
"On the cofinality of infinite partially ordered set:
 factoring a poset into lean essential subsets"

(1) intro an presenting the problem of forward analysis of WSTS and acceleration.
(2) lub-acceleration: representing the limit elements (sobrification).
(3) removing the dependence on the path (abstract interpretation of WSTS).
(4) widening: like acceleration but reasoning only about the underlying space.
(5) flat abstraction: always terminating analysis.


Definitions:
------------

* poset, WQO (why quasi and not partial?)
A quasi-order (preorder) in a reflexive and transitive relation.
A partial order is a reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric relation.
A well-quasi-order is a quasi-order that has no infinite antichain or infinite strictly decreasing sequence.

Why using quasi order rather than partial orders:
  Because anti-symmetry is not needed for most of the proofs.
  In practice, most of the quasi-orders that people use are partial-orders.

* upward/downward closure:
  \downarrow X = { y | \exists x \in X s.t. y \leq x }

* cofinal, cofinality
A subset Q of a poset P is cofinal iff P \subseteq \downarrow Q.
The cofinality of P, cf(P), is the least cardinality of its cofinal subset.

A subset that is not cofinal is called small.

In the rest of this talk we speaks about: countable poset (aleph_0) that have countable cofinality.

* Special sets:
chain: a set where every two element is comparable.
directed: all pairs of elements admit a least upper bound.
lean: P is lean iff all subsets size at least cf(P) are cofinal in P.
divisible: P is divisible if it is the union of two (fewer than cf(P)) small subsets,
essential: if it is the complement of a small set.
