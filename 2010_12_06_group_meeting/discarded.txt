what to present:
(1) work with Krish
(2) work with Thomas

make it interactive

=====
= 1 =
=====
-present the problem: evolution of cooperation in the repeated prisoner's dilemma.
-present the question of learning: cultural vs genetic evolution.
-present the simple version:
  fixed strategies C,D,AllC,AllD,TFT
  beta, payoff matrix
  eta, selection + learning matrix
-show simulations
-question: where are the equilibria ?
-solving for the equilibria:
    system of equations, parameters (x1,x2,y1,eta,beta),
    show the repartition of the equilibria in function of eta + beta,
    get rid of variables: y1 = (1+x1-x2)/2, x2 ~= 0,
    solve the systems solution on the corner + roots,
    the existence of the interior solutions,
    getting beta= fct(eta) for the point where the sqrt root is defined.
-Et voila!

=====

-a few examples: cool stuff that we want to verify but that are not intuitive.
    pingpong
    pi approximation
    implicit sender
    closure

-inclusion check:
  canonical form for graphs ? (link to anti-chain)
  subgraph isomorphism
  not injective on replicated nodes
  sat-encoding ? (pigeonhole problem)
-recursive process network:
  WSTS view: downward compatible WSTS, subcovering problem ...
