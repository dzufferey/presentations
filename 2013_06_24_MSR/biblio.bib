  ABSTRACT     = {We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for modal,
     description and hybrid logic that improves on previous proposals in
     important ways. It avoids translations into large undecidable logics,
     and works directly on modal, description or hybrid logic formulas instead.
     In addition, by using the hybrid machinery it avoids the complexities
     of earlier propositional resolution-based methods for modal logic.
     It combines ideas from the method of prefixes used in tableaux,
     and resolution ideas in such a way that some of the heuristics
     and optimizations devised in either field are applicable}

In this chapter we describe the theoretical concepts and results

for first-order clause logic with equality. We mainly concentrate on
refinements of paramodulation, such as the superposition calculus,
that have yielded the most promising results  to date in automated
equational reasoning.},

to be a property of clauses relative
to a term ordering.   This property is a kind of
generalization of the subformula property for proofs where
the terms appearing in proofs can be bounded,
under the given ordering,
by terms appearing in the goal clause.  We show that when a clause set is
order local, then the complexity of its ground entailment problem is
a function of its structure (e.g., full versus Horn clauses),
and the ordering used.   We prove that, in many cases, order locality
is equivalent to a clause set being saturated
under ordered resolution.  This provides a means of using standard
resolution theorem provers for testing order locality and
transforming non-local clause sets into local ones.
We have used the Saturate system to automatically establish complexity
bounds for a number of nontrivial entailment problems
relative to complexity classes which include polynomial and
exponential time and co-NP.

  ABSTRACT =	 {This paper presents two approaches to primitive equality treatment in
                  higher-order (HO) automated theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$
                  adapting traditional first-order (FO) paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and
                  a calculus $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO
                  logic (based on Church's simply typed $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$
                  and $\EXTRUE$ extend the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin completeness
                  without the need for additional extensionality axioms both calculi
                  employ new, positive extensionality rules analogously to the respective
                  negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that operate on unification
                  constraints. As the extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
                  looses its pure term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise rather well with the
                  difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution idea.}

 , abstract     = {Libra is a general-purpose programming language based on the
                   algebra of binary relations.  It attempts to unify functional
                   and logic programming, retaining the advantages of both, and
                   avoiding some of the problems.  It has all the features needed
                   of a programming language, and a straightforward semantic
                   interpretation.  Since program specifications are easily
                   expressed as relations, it offers a simple path from a
                   specification to a program and from the program to its proof
                   of correctness.  The algebra of binary relations has several
                   operators whose effects are like those of familiar procedural
                   language constructs, for example, relational composition is
                   analogous to sequential execution. The Libra language is
                   illustrated by its application to a simple programming exercise.
                   Some conclusions are drawn.}

   abstract    = {Pattern matching makes ML programs more concise and
                 readable, and these qualities are also sought in
                 object-oriented settings. However, objects and classes
                 come with open class hierarchies, extensibility
                 requirements and the need for data abstraction, which all
                 conflict with matching on concrete data types.
                 Extractor-based pattern matching has been proposed to
                 address this conflict. Extractors are user-defined
                 methods that perform the task of value discrimination and
                 deconstruction during pattern matching. In this paper, we
                 give the first formalization of extractor-based matching,
                 using a first-order object-oriented calculus. We give a
                 direct operational semantics and prove it sound. We then
                 present an optimizing translation to a target language
                 without matching, and prove a correctness result stating
                 that an expression is equivalent to its translation.},

set of formulas that do not contain function symbols,
that possibly contain equality, and that contain at
most two variables. This paper shows how resolution
theorem-proving techniques can be used to provide an
algorithm for deciding whether or not any given formula
in the two-variable fragment is satisfiable. Previous
resolution-based techniques could deal only with the
equality-free subset of the two-variable fragment. },

We describe a decision procedure for a logic that supports

the cardinality operator 3) a total order relation on elements,

applications of this logic are 1) reasoning about the
externally observable behavior of data structures such as
random access priority queues, 2) specifying witness functions for
synthesis problem of set algebra, and 3) reasoning about
constraints on orderings arising in termination proofs.

  abstract = {
We present decision procedures for logical constraints that
support reasoning about collections of elements such as
sets, multisets, and fuzzy sets.  Element membership in such
collections is given by a characteristic function from a
finite universe (of unknown size) to a subset of rational
numbers specified by user-defined constraints in mixed
linear integer-rational arithmetic.  Our logic supports
standard operators such as union, intersection, difference,
or any operation defined pointwise using mixed linear
integer-rational arithmetic.  Moreover, it supports the
notion of cardinality of the collection.  Deciding formulas
in such logic has application in verification of data
structures.
Our decision procedure reduces satisfiability of formulas
with collections to satisfiability of formulas in an
extension of mixed linear integer-rational arithmetic with
an ``unbounded sum'' operator.  Such extension is also
interesting in its own right because it can encode
reachability problems for a simple class of transition
systems.  We present a decision procedure for the resulting
extension, using a satisfiability-preserving transformation
that eliminates the unbounded sum operator.  Our
decidability result subsumes previous special cases for sets
and multisets.

  abstract = {
We consider an extension of integer linear arithmetic with a
star operator that takes closure under vector addition of
the set of solutions of linear arithmetic subformula.  We
show that the satisfiability problem for this language is in
NP (and therefore NP-complete).  Our proof uses a
generalization of a recent result on sparse solutions of
integer linear programming problems.  We present two
consequences of our result.  The first one is an optimal
decision procedure for a logic of sets,
multisets, and cardinalities that has applications in
verification, interactive theorem proving, and description
logics.  The second is  NP-completeness of the
reachability problem for a class of ``homogeneous''
transition systems whose transitions are defined using
integer linear arithmetic formulas.

abstract = {{
The mechanism for declaring datatypes to model data structures in
programming languages such as Standard ML and Haskell can offer both
convenience in programming and clarity in code.  With the introduction of
dependent datatypes in DML, the programmer can model data structures with
more accuracy, thus capturing more program invariants.  In this paper, we
study some practical aspects of dependent datatypes that affect both
type-checking and compiling pattern matching.  The results, which have
already been tested, demonstrate that dependent datatype can not only offer
various programming benefits but also lead to performance gains, yielding a
concrete case where safer programs run faster.
