Title:
    Verification of message-passing programs: model checking and
    session types perspectives

Abstract:
    Implementing communication protocols is a routine task in modern
connected software. However, verifying that a protocol is implemented
correctly is still a challenge. In this talk, I will give an overview of
the research on this topic. First, I will discuss communicating finite
state machines, one of the most basic model in this domain, and explain
why it is already Turing powerful. Then, we will look at session types
which approach the problem by looking at the communication channels
rather than the processes actions. After comparing the advantages and
limitations of each approach, I'll briefly discuss ongoing research we
are pursing on this topic.
