## Ways of creating models

* 2D sketches and extrusion (linear, rotation, and along a path)

* Constructive Solid Geometry

* Many more
  - Triangle mesh
  - NURBS
  - Isosurface (metaballs, implicit surface)
  - ...

## What we will do today

Let's make a _fidget spinner_.

People seem to like them. Don't ask. There is even a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_spinner)...

We will do one version is [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/) and one version in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).

We will also make a simple example of 3D modeling in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## Alternative tools

There are plenty of alternatives:
* Graphical CAD:
  - [Fusion 360](http://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
  - [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/)
  - [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/)
  - [Solidworks](http://www.solidworks.com/)
  - ...
* Procedural CAD:
  - [Antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony) (GUI + Python API)
  - [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org/) (GUI + CSG libray in JavaScript)
  - [ImplicitCad](https://github.com/colah/ImplicitCAD) (CSG library in Haskell)
  - [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) (CSG library in Python)
  - [Scadla](https://github.com/dzufferey/scadla) (CSG library in Scala)
  - ...
